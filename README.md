# [NotBook](https://idkbuster40.github.io/NotBook)



NotBook is a writing software which is designed to be very lightweight, targeting multiple platforms modern, old and underpowered.

Inspired by FocusWriter, WriteMonkey and more, with (basic) markdown implementation and simple formatting in a markdown-esque manner like the examples below;
left, right, center and justified and more using symbols like `<-\`,`->\`, `^\` and `~\`. It should also merge with the `##` and `###` which is supported by markdown.
Data saving is handled in the web browser, more features will be added over time.

Just like the name, it is not a book and should not be confused for one.

Check the branches with the appropriate version number like: `1.00` or `0.10` or `release` for the stable version(s). For experimental platforms like the older phones/kindle see `experimental` or `legacy-support`

TODO:

>Add working word counter.
>Add formatting features which work.
