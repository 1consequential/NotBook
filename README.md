# NotBook


NotBook is a writing software which is designed to be very lightweight, targeting multiple platforms modern, old and underpowered. 

Inspired by FocusWriter, WriteMonkey and more, with (basic) markdown implementation and simple formatting in a markdown-esque manner like the examples below;
left, right, center and justified and more using symbols like `<-\`,`->\`, `^` and `~\`. It should also merge with the `##` and `###` which is supported by markdown.
Data saving is handled in the web browser, more features will be added over time.

Just like the name, it is not a book and should not be confused for one.
